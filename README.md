# CSharpBeginnerProjects

Hi there, these are some very beginner C# projects to track my learning of the language. Just starting with back-end. Most of the projects will be from Code Academy, others from tech influencers giving recomendations on projects to learn, and others from my university classes.

Thanks for reading.
